Saber extension for Safari
=======


##Small extension in which you can appear a Lightsaber as your cursor.

It will make sounds once you shake it and follow the cursor.

Made entirely for fun and educational purposed based on work of [FranPR9](https://twitter.com/FranPR9) that created the lightsaber in js. (He's working on the safari extesion right as you are reading this ;))

We both are working in [Akademio right now](http://www.akademio.xyz) please be an early adopter ;)

Here's the course with the initial take on the lightsaber btw:
